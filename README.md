# Deployement-of-Automatic-Water-Quality-Prediction-System-on-Streamlit-Cloud
 The project aims to develop  the classification model that can label any new water sample as either safe or unsafe for  drinking based on the parameters such as aluminium, ammonia, fluoride, chromium, copper  and bacteria with high accuracy.


## Deploying a Machine Learning model on Streamlit Cloud involves the following steps:

Step 1: Create a requeriments.txt file at the root of your folder with the libraries that we used

Step 2: Create a new GitHub repository and push your code over there.

Step 3: Create a Streamlit account and connect your GitHub profile to it.

Step 4: Now, on the Streamlit dashboard click the “New app” button and Link your Streamlit app with your GitHub repository.

Step 5: Click “Deploy” and you’re all done!
